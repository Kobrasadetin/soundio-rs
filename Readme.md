# soundio-rs

This is a Rust wrapper for the amazing [libsoundio library](http://libsound.io/)
by [Andrew Kelly](https://github.com/andrewrk). It is still a work in progress and
the design is still in flux. Playback and recording do work though, and the raw bindings
in `libsoundio-sys` are complete.

There is another Rust wrapper for libsoundio [here](https://github.com/klingtnet/rsoundio).

Also note this is my first Rust project, so I may have got everything totally wrong.

Shot is the best. :-)
