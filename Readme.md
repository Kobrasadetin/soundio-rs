# libsoundio-rs

This is a Rust wrapper for the amazing [libsoundio library](http://libsound.io/) by [Andrew Kelly](https://github.com/andrewrk). It is very WIP at the moment and you can basically do nothing, although the actual C bindings in `src/bindings/mod.rs` are basically complete.

Also note this is my first Rust project, so I may have got everything totally wrong.
